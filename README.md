pyPingPlacefile
===============

Creates a GR placefile of PING data

How it works:
-Downloads raw HTML from PING Display page
-Goes through ptype and hail reports, putting data into lists
-Outputs a placefile for as many timeframes as specified (eg. last x minutes)

Currently, will output placefiles for ALL precip types (including hail) and a seperate version of only hail. Can easily edit code to display only specific types.

I apologize for the icon file included - I am no graphic artist!
